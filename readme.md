## Description
For this project, I created a small web app to familiarize myself with laravel. I created a lorem ipsum generator and a random user generator. Both generators allow a user to select an amount of paragraphs/users from 1 to 99. Additionally, I added the code from my xkcd password generator to this project as well as a link to the password generator.

## Demo
My demo will be done live during section. As with the last project, if anything changes, I will be sure to let my TA know as soon as possible and I will update this readme file with a link to a demo video.

## Outside Sources
I used the two packages that were recommended to us in the assignment specification, badcow/lorem-ipsum and fzaninotto/faker.
