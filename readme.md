## Description
For this project, I created a small web app to familiarize myself with laravel. I created a lorem ipsum generator and a random user generator. Both generators allow a user to select an amount of paragraphs/users from 1 to 99. Additionally, I added the code from my xkcd password generator to this project as well as a link to the password generator.

## Demo
I originaly intended to do my demo live during section, but because I was unable to attend section today, I have uploaded a jing screencast and contacted my TF.The screencast link for my demo is http://screencast.com/t/yrRYqqsgmsO


## Outside Sources
I used the two packages that were recommended to us in the assignment specification, badcow/lorem-ipsum and fzaninotto/faker.
